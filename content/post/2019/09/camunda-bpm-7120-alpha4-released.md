## Handling Bpmn Error and Escalation in User Tasks

In case a business error occur during the exection of an External Task, it is possible to raise a Bpmn Error via the [Java API](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/user-guide/process-engine/external-tasks/#reporting-bpmn-error) or [Rest API](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/reference/rest/external-task/post-bpmn-error/).
But have you ever wanted to escalate an user task or indicate a busniss error for user task? Within this alpha you can now report a [Bpmn Error](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/reference/bpmn20/events/error-events/#business-errors-vs-technical-errors) or an [Escalation](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/reference/bpmn20/events/escalation-events/) for an user task.
Whenever a business error occur the user can invoke via [Java](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/reference/bpmn20/tasks/user-task/#reporting-bpmn-error) or [Rest](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/reference/rest/task/post-bpmn-error/) API a Bpmn Error which will be thrown:

```json
POST /task/aTaskId/bpmnError
{
  "errorCode": "process-order-error-543",
  "errorMessage": "An error occurred during processing order",
  "variables": {
	  "orderNumber" : {
		  "value" : "PL-233",
		  "type": "String"
	  }
  }
}
```
If in process is implemented an error catch event with the respective `errorCode`, the Bpmn Error will be catched and propagated accordingly. The same goes for the reporting an escalation, the respective documentation can be found as follows [Java](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/reference/bpmn20/tasks/user-task/#reporting-bpmn-escalation) and [Rest](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/reference/rest/task/post-bpmn-escalation/) API.

## Cascading Changes to Due Dates of Recurring Timers
Within a BPMN model, a user can specify a recurring timer with an [ISO-8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Repeating_intervals) interval string. (e.g. "R3/PT30M")
The timer stores a due date to indicate when it is ready for execution. For recurring timer, the engine calculates the due date based on the cycle (e.g. "PT30M") and creates a subsequent timer whenever a recurring timer is executed until the number of repeats ("R3" = repeated three times) is reached.

Given a "R3/PT30M" recurring, every timer instance is due 30 minutes after the previous one.
{{< figure src="no-change.png" alt="three 30-minute intervals indicating the three timer due dates">}}
Via the managementService it is possible to update the due date of a timer instance. If the due date of <b>Timer1</b> is altered by 15 minutes via `managementService.setJobDuedate(String jobId, Date newDuedate)` the three timers are executed differently.

{{< figure src="non-cascading-change.png" alt="timer 1 is due after 45min, timer 2 after 60min and timer 3 after 90min">}}
The due date of <b>Timer 1</b> was altered by +15 minutes, so it is due after 45 minutes. However, <b>Timer 2</b> and <b>Timer 3</b> are not affected by this and their due date is still based on the original due date of <b>Timer 1</b>.

However, what if you want a due date change to cascade to subsequent timer instances?
{{< figure src="cascading-change.png" alt="one 45-minute interval then two 30-minute intervals indicating the three timer due dates">}}
With this release you can use the `cascade` flag (via [REST API](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/reference/rest/job/put-set-job-duedate/)) or `managementService.setJobDuedate(String jobId, Date newDuedate, boolean cascade)` to achieve this.
